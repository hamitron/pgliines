#README

This is the new rendition of Twiines.  Since the old version got messy, I started from a clean slate.
This is much simpler.  It displays datapoints in a timeline.  If there is a picture, it pops that into a timeline as well.

The layout is broken down as follows:

Each user has tracks.
Tracks contain milestones and stones.
A milestone is a goal post.  You want to reach milestones.  Set them up before you add stones.
A stone is where you are.  If you run 5 miles, make a stone of five miles.
Twines (I removed the second 'i') are a little different than before.
A twine is now a collection of tracks from different users.
If five people had the same tracks, the would probably benefit from using a twine.  That way they could
chart each other's progress.

The twine isn't implemented yet, so you just have tracks for now.  Tracks are cool though!  Use tracks.
